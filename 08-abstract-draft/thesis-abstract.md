### Keywords
Street art, graffiti, mobile app, navigation, augmented reality


### Motivation/Problem/Opportunity
I will try to create an application that would bring this topic closer to the general public, 
and possibly try to change the negative view of most people on this kind of art. 
In the end, the application should form a mobile guide to Prague's street art and graffiti works. 
Users should learn through it styles, artists and places in Prague.

continue to be used and possibly develop in other cities.
