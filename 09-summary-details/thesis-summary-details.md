# Mobile app Street me

In this presentation are things which you didn't see in last presentation, only things which were made after it.


## Abstract Draft

The theme of this bachelor thesis is to design a mobile application that will be a guide to 
Prague's street art and graffiti art with elements of augmented reality.  
The theoretical aspect deals with the history, characteristics and development of mobile applications. 
At the same time, this section analyzes competing applications and dissects the concepts that accompany this bachelor thesis. 
The closure to the theoretical part describes the aim of the work.  The practical part of the work analyzes the user survey and the application itself. 
Marketing, promotion and monetization of the application are also developed in this segment.  The conclusion of this section is devoted to user testing.
 
 
## Keywords

Mobile application, street art, graffiti, augmented reality, art 

## Logo
The logo consist of two elements. I was thinking about the main element of the street and i chose the street lamp.
I wanted some element that would be original and woldnt be changeable for some art shops. 
The main element for the street art and graffiti creation is street and that led me to an idea with street lamp. 
The second element in logo is letter S which is connected to the app name.

## Claim
I made also claim for my app, which is street me meet me. I wanted something, which you can remember easy.
App communictaion is such a game. For example, when a competition takes a place, we will say FIND ME! 
For talk with artist - Meet me!

## Font
The font in the application must be easy to read, contrast and functional, so I chose the Montserrat font. 
It is a geometric sans serif font containing multiple cuts.

## Prototype
Except for a few of the shortcomings I'm redesigning, the application prototype is ready
The entry point serves as a crossroads for new and existing users. If you are a new user, the application will explain the uses of it in a few steps

## Map for print
In addition to the application, I created a map that the user can print at home. You can find it in the "About" section. 
The map is intended for those who do not understand the applications, but would like to visit places with street art and graffiti. 
Or for those who simply want to spend the day offline.

## Advertising
As for advertising, In this case, I came up with the concept of tables with a QR code, which would be located directly next to the work. 
The user would scan the QR code. Through it, he would be directed to a website with a shorter description of the application, and the possibility of downloading the application.
After the user downloads the application, he will see the work he is in and information about it after confirming the location services. 
Another way to promote the application is through posters or billboards.
